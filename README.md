Subject:  Application for a Marathon

Summary: 

The objective of this project is to develop a JavaScript application that sets up a registration form for marathon participants based on their age and start time of the race. The marathon is divided into two categories according to the age of the runners: adults, who are 18 years and older, and youth, who are under 18 years old. Early adult participants will be assigned a race number at or above 1000, while all other participants will receive a number below 1000. Adults can register for the race at either 9:30 AM or 11:00 AM. Early adults will commence the race at 9:30 AM, while other adult participants will begin at 11:30 AM. Youth participants will start the race at 12:30 PM, regardless of their registration time.
